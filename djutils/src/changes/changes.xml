    <release version="1.01.02" date="2019-07-02" description="ImmutableLinkedHashMap.values() repaired">
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="fix">
        The ImmutableLinkedHashMap.values() was overriding a non-reproducible values() method from the 
        ImmutableAbstractMap. The ImmutableLinkedHashMap now has its own values() method.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="fix">
        The byte[][] serialization destroyed the underlying data -- this has been repaired.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="update">
        The serializers have all been made strongly typed, avoiding casting. Or actually, the casting has been 
        shifted to the encode method on a higher level.
      </action>
    </release>
  
    <release version="1.01.01" date="2019-07-01" description="ImmutableLinkedHashMap repaired; serialization of UTF-8, UTF-16">
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="fix">
        The ImmutableLinkedHashMap returned a non-linked HashSet as EntrySet and as KeySet. This has
        been repaired.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="fix">
        The UTF-8 Strings in djutils-serialization have been improved. The UTF-8 String can now handle 
        1-byte, 2-byte, 3-byte and 4-byte characters. The length of the UTF-8 serialized bytes indicates
        the number of bytes. The length does not say anything about the number of characters.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="fix">
        The UTF-16 Strings in djutils-serialization have been improved. The UTF-16 String can now handle
        2-byte and 4-byte characters. The length of the UTF-16 String indicates the number of 2-byte
        shorts in the array. The length does not say anything about the number of characters.
      </action>
      <action dev="pknoppers" type="fix">
        The byte array in djutils-serialization has been repaired. The underlying byte array was nulled 
        during serialization.
      </action>
      <action dev="pknoppers" type="add">
        ObjectArraySerializer and ObjectMatrixSerializer added. 
      </action>
      <action dev="pknoppers" type="add">
        SerialDataDumper added to provide insight into structure of the serialized data.
      </action>
    </release>

    <release version="1.01.00" date="2019-06-21" description="djutils-serialization project added">
      <action dev="pknoppers" type="add">
        The djunits-serialization project has been added to serialize and deserialize different classes
        including djunits scalars, vectors and matrices in a strongly typed manner.
      </action>
    </release>

    <release version="1.00.06" date="2019-05-10" description="EntrySets added; caching of keySet, values in Map">
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="add">
        EntrySets have been added to the ImmutableMap classes.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="update">
        The keySet(), values() and entrySet() methods cache the results as these are often called.
      </action>
    </release>

    <release version="1.00.05" date="2019-02-26" description="ImmutableCollections class added">
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="add">
        The ImmutableCollections class has been added, which takes care of those functions of the
        Collections class that do not update the (immutable) collections that the methods receive
        as arguments.
      </action>
    </release>

    <release version="1.00.04" date="2019-01-29" description="Removed logger Cat class">
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="remove">
        Cat class in the logger package belongs in dsol, not in djutils, so removed it.
      </action>
    </release>

    <release version="1.00.03" date="2018-12-18" description="DecoderDumper package">
      <action dev="pknoppers" type="add">
        The 'decoderdumper' package has been added to the djutils project, extending
        and replacing HexDump. 
      </action>
    </release>

    <release version="1.00.02" date="2019-01-17" description="ConditionalLogger, HexDump">
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="add">
        The CategoryLogger has been extended with a 'when(condition)' static method. 
        A call like CategoryLogger.when(ok).always().info("Ok"); is now possible.
      </action>
      <action dev="pknoppers" type="add">
        The HexDump class has been added to djutils to create hexadecimal dumps of data.
      </action>
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="update">
        Copyright message changed to 2019.

    <release version="1.00.00" date="2018-11-17" description="Initial release">
      <action dev="averbraeck" type="add">
        Several classes from other projects that are heavily shared between the projects, but not 
        specific for one of the projects have been transferred to the djutils project.
